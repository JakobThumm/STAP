====== Introduction ======
You are part of a personalized robot motion planner. 
We assume access to a library of manipulation primitives. Each primitive can be parametrized by an action `a`. 
The goal is to output actions for primitives that are preferable for humans and geometrically feasible.
We can check geometric feasiblity with a feasibility checker and don't need your help with that.
Your task is to write a custom preference function for each skill in a task plan. The preference function should output the probability that a human collaborative partner would be satisfied with the performed actions.
The functions have the following footprint
```
def {Primitive.name}PreferenceFn(
    state: torch.Tensor,
    action: torch.Tensor, 
    next_state: torch.Tensor, 
    primitive: Optional[Primitive] = None, 
    env: Optional[Environment] = None
) -> torch.Tensor:
    r"""Evaluates the preference probability of the {Primitive.name} primitive.

    Args:
        state [batch_size, state_dim]: Current state.
        action [batch_size, action_dim]: Action.
        next_state [batch_size, state_dim]: Predicted next state after executing this action.
        primitive: Optional primitive to receive the object information from
        env: Optional environment to receive the object information from

    Returns:
        The probability that action `a` on primitive {Primitive.name} satisfies the preferences of the human partner. 
            Output shape: [batch_size] \in [0, 1].

====== Scene Description ======
There are the following objects in the scene:
An object loaded from an URDF with name table and bounding box [3.000, 2.730, 0.050].
A screwdriver named screwdriver with a rod and a handle. The screwdriver can be picked both at the rod and the handle. The handle points in negative x direction `main_axis = [-1, 0, 0]`, the rod in the positive x direction `main_axis = [1, 0, 0]` of the object in the object frame. The object frame has its origin at the point where the rod and the handle meet. The object properties are: handle_length=0.090, rod_length=0.075, handle_radius=0.020, rod_radius=0.008.
A human body part named left_hand. 
A human body part named right_hand. 
The objects have the following predicate:
free(screwdriver)
on(screwdriver, table)
===== Task Description =====
The sequence of skills to execute is as follows:
Pick(screwdriver) This primitive is used to pick up objects with the robot gripper.
static_handover(screwdriver, right_hand) This primitive is used to hand over objects to the human. The next state describes the position and orientation of the object at the exact time of the handover.
===== Helper Functions =====
You can call the following helper functions in your custom preference function:
get_object_id_from_name(name: str, env: Env) -> int:
"""Return the object identifier from a given object name."""

get_object_id_from_primitive(arg_id: int, primitive: Primitive) -> int:
"""Return the object identifier from a primitive and its argument id.
Example: The primitive `Place` has two argument ids: `object` with `arg_id = 0` and `target` with `arg_id = 1`.
"""

get_pose(state: torch.Tensor, object_id: int, frame: int = -1) -> torch.Tensor:
"""Return the pose of an object in the requested frame.

Args:
    state: state (observation) to extract the pose from.
    object_id: number identifying the obect. Can be retrieved with `get_object_id_from_name()` and
        `get_object_id_from_primitive()`.
    frame: the frame to represent the pose in. Default is `-1`, which is world frame. In our simulation, the base
        frame equals the world frame. Give the object id for other frames, e.g., `0` for end effector frame.
Returns:
    The pose in shape [..., 7] with format [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz], with the rotation represented as a quaternion.
"""

    pose_1: torch.Tensor, pose_2: torch.Tensor, norm: str = "L2", axes: Sequence[str] = ["x", "y", "z"]
) -> torch.Tensor:
"""Calculate the norm of the positional difference of two poses along the given axes.

Args:
    pose_{1, 2}: the poses of the two objects.
    norm: which norm to calculate. Choose from 'L1', 'L2', and 'Linf'. Defaults to `L2`.
    axes: calculate the norm along the given axes and ignore all other axes. Choose entries from `{'x', 'y', 'z'}`.
Returns:
    The norm in shape [..., 1]
"""

great_circle_distance_metric(pose_1: torch.Tensor, pose_2: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
"""Calculate the difference in orientation in radians of two poses using the great circle distance.

Assumes that the position entries of the poses are direction vectors `v1` and `v2`.
The great circle distance is then `d = arccos(dot(v1, v2))` in radians.

pointing_in_direction_metric(
    pose_1: torch.Tensor, pose_2: torch.Tensor, main_axis: Sequence[float] = [1, 0, 0]

"""Evaluate if an object is pointing in a given direction.

Rotates the given main axis by the rotation of pose_1 and calculates the `great_circle_distance()`
between the rotated axis and pose_2.position.
Args:
    pose_1: the orientation of this pose is used to rotate the `main_axis`.
    pose_2: compare the rotated `main_axis` with the position vector of this pose.
    main_axis: axis describing in which direction an object is pointing in its default configuration.
Returns:
    The great circle distance in radians between the rotated `main_axis` and the position part of `pose_2`.
"""

rotation_angle_metric(pose_1: torch.Tensor, pose_2: torch.Tensor, axis: Sequence[float]) -> torch.Tensor:
"""Calculate the rotational difference between pose_1 and pose_2 around the given axis.

Example: The orientation 1 is not rotated and the orientation 2 is rotated around the z-axis by 90 degree.
    Then if the given axis is [0, 0, 1], the function returns pi/2.
    If the given axis is [1, 0, 0], the function returns 0, as there is no rotation around the x-axis.

Args:
    pose_{1, 2}: the orientations of the two poses are used to calculate the rotation angle.
    axis: The axis of interest to rotate around.

Returns:
    The angle difference in radians along the given axis.
"""

threshold_probability(metric: torch.Tensor, threshold: float, is_smaller_then: bool = True) -> torch.Tensor:
"""If `is_smaller_then`: return `1.0` if `metric < threshold` and `0.0` otherwise.
If not `is_smaller_then`: return `1.0` if `metric >= threshold` and `0.0` otherwise.

====== Example ======
An example task could be to pick up a box and place it next to another box, so both boxes are orientated in the same direction.
The resulting preference function for the `Pick` and `Place` primitive could be:
```
